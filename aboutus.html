                    <p class="btw-text">Our company SunbeamCars Inc. was established more than 30 years ago and it is currently lead by Lisa and Peter, who together are responsible for the day-today operations. The couple's two daughters and their sons-in-law help when things are busy. Lisa and Peter have now passed retirement age and want to divest the company. Their youngest daughter, Emma, and their son-in-law Liam have expressed a desire to take over the company and a transfer process has been initiated. Due to this generational change, the company is currently undergoing the digitization and modernisation processes, as Emma and Liam want to improve the quality of the service and client’s experience.</p>

                    <p class="btw-text">We rent out cars and among our customers you will find everyone - businesspeople, tourists and people who need to rent a car because they do not have one. If you are over 18 years old and have a driver’s license, you can use our services. We currentlyhave 25 cars with varied capacity - you can choose whether you want to take more people or luggage. As we plan to expand in the future, more options will be added with time. However, we still want to maintain the company as a family business - we do it with passion and lots of people trusted us.<br>See you on the way!</p>

                    <p class="btw-text">The company is located at a transport hub, from where buses and trains arrive and depart regularly. Rented cars must be both picked up and dropped off at the company's office, which is located next to the garage, where the cars are parked and where they are also cleaned so that they can be rented out again.</p>
